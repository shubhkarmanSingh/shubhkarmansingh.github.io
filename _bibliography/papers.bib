  author={S. Singh},
  abstract={This thesis delves into the multifaceted landscape of computer science education within underprivi- leged and underrepresented communities, focusing on its impact on students’ journey towards higher education. Grounded in the principles of cultural capital and asset-based teaching methodologies, this research endeavors to address the barriers confronting students by offering tailored workshops. These workshops provide a scaffolded framework that empowers students and families to navigate educational opportunities, financial aid, mental health, and more. The thesis explores the significance of cultural capital in shaping students’ academic trajectories and advocates for an approach that ac- knowledges and leverages the diverse strengths within these communities. By integrating culturally relevant content, collaborative curriculum design, and dynamic teaching methods, the workshops aim to foster inclusivity and empowerment. The culmination of this effort reflects a commitment to cre- ating an educational landscape characterized by equity, unity, and transformative growth.},

  abstract={Currently, there are many ML models that, given a patient's ECG, can diagnose whether that patient has AFib with high accuracy. The issue with many of these models is that they are black- box models which make it difficult for community healthcare workers to interpret their decisions. Our solution is AFib-XAI, a program that uses explainable AI methods to display the important data points and regions of interest in an ECG that were factored into a model’s AFib diagnosis, as well as generate accurate, human-readable explanations for that model’s diagnosis. AFib-XAI can be run through a command-line interface. The program offers a selection of 3 AFib diagnostic deep learning models and 4 SHAP-based explainability methods. The user must provide an ECG, make a model se- lection, and select an explainability method. Af- terward, the program will be run. Once the program has finished running, the user will be given a visual result from the SHAP explainability method, as well as a very basic text explanation generated from the results.},
