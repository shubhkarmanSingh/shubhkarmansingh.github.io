For now, this page is assumed to be a static description of your courses. You can convert it to a collection similar to `_projects/` so that you can have a dedicated page for each course.

Organize your courses by years, topics, or universities, however you like!

<!-- Display projects without categories -->
  {%- assign sorted_projects = site.projects | sort: "importance" -%}
  <!-- Generate cards for each project -->

    {%- for project in sorted_projects -%}
      {% include projects_horizontal.html %}
