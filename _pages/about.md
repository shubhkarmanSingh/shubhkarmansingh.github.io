I am Shubhkarman Singh or Karman for short. I graduated from the University of Washington with a Masters in Computer Science focused in machine learning.

Day to day, I think about this question: how does my work tangibly benefit the individuals around me? My journey has taken me across the communities of vision-impaired individuals, undocumented immigrants, and community health workers, all of whom played a vital role in answering this question. Through my time at the University of Washington, as an undergraduate and masterâ€™s computer science student, I explored machine learning as a tool to pursue this vision, and more specifically, the tool of explainable AI to not only open new solutions for various communities but also allow us to question why these AI solutions work. This is the guiding research question that I hope to delve deeper into through my PhD journey.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below.
